# Lending Club Case Study
> This case study is a small project which use the information from a consumer finance company i.e. Lending Club about past loan applicants and identifies the driving factors and indicators which should be used to approve or deny the loan. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.There is always a risk while granting loan to an applicant. If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.

## General Information
- This project uses EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) to identify the main factors why applicants default the loan. The main emphasize was given on data cleaning, structuring, transformation, and univariate and bivariate analysis with visualizations using Python to figure out the driving factors of Loan default.


## Conclusions
* Applications  with  ‘Higher amounts’ loans (> $15000) should be thoroughly reviewed. 

* Applications with purpose 'debt consolidation’ and grade 'G to B' should be thoroughly reviewed before approving their loan application.

* Lending club should raise interest rates or stop loans to ‘Small businesses’ as there are more than 25% of defaulters in this segment.

* While providing loans for term 60 months the club should do a background check for public records of the applicants. 

* Public record should be checked for all borrowers because borrowers with higher number of public records tend to have a higher default rate.

* It is believed that the large number of open account tend to have higher default rate. However, our analysis did not show significant differences. 
   There is not enough data to conclude that borrowers with more than 30 accounts tend to have higher default rate.

* Lending club should carefully review interest rate of Low Grades applicants because the Loans having higher interest rate have more defaulters.
