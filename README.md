# Lending Club Case Study
> This case study is a small project which use the information from a consumer finance company i.e. Lending Club about past loan applicants and identifies the driving factors and indicators which should be used to approve or deny the loan. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile.There is always a risk while granting loan to an applicant. If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss.

## Conclusions
* Applications  with  ‘Higher amounts’ loans (> $15000) should be thoroughly reviewed. 

* Applications with purpose of loans as 'debt consolidation’ should be closely looked before approving their loan application.

* Lending club should stop approving loans for ‘Small businesses’  as there are good number of defaulters with small businesses.

* While providing loans for term 60 months the club should do a good background check of the applicants. 

* Public record should be checked for borrowers with higher public record of bankruptcies as they have higher tendency of defaulting the loan.

* It is believed that the large number of open account tend to have higher default rate. However, our analysis did not show significant differences. 
   There is not enough data to conclude that borrowers with more than 30 accounts tend to have higher default rate.  

* Low grade loans have high tendency to default. Lending club should examine more information from borrowers before issuing loans to Low grade (G to A).

* Loans having higher interest rate have more defaulters. Check the background of applicant thoroughly before calculating interest rates.
